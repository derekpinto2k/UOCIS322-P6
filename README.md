# UOCIS322 - Project 6 #
Brevet time calculator with AJAX, MongoDB, and a RESTful API!

Brevet time calculator.

## Overview

Reimplement the RUSA ACP controle time calculator with Flask and AJAX.

### ACP controle times

That's *"controle"* with an *e*, because it's French, although "control" is also accepted. Controls are points where a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the minimum and maximum times by which the rider must arrive at the location.

The algorithm for calculating controle times is described here [https://rusa.org/pages/acp-brevet-control-times-calculator](https://rusa.org/pages/acp-brevet-control-times-calculator). Additional background information is given here [https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders](https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders). The description is ambiguous, but the examples help. Part of finishing this project is clarifying anything that is not clear about the requirements, and documenting it clearly.  

We are essentially replacing the calculator here [https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html](https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html). We can also use that calculator to clarify requirements and develop test data.  

Inserts and retrieves times using mongo database with implemented Submit and Display buttons

### Functionality added

## API ##

 * Three basic APIs (JSON is the default representation for these):
    * "http://<host:port>/listAll" should return all open and close times in the database
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly" should return open times only
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly" should return close times only

* You will also design two different representations JSON & CSV:
    * "http://<host:port>/listAll/csv" should return all open and close times in CSV format
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/csv" should return open times only in CSV format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/csv" should return close times only in CSV format

    * "http://<host:port>/listAll/json" should return all open and close times in JSON format
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/json" should return open times only in JSON format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/json" should return close times only in JSON format

* Query parameter 'top' to find the k = top times for the given api.

    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/csv?top=3" should return top 3 open times only (in ascending order) in CSV format
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/json?top=5" should return top 5 open times only (in ascending order) in JSON format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/csv?top=6" should return top 5 close times only (in ascending order) in CSV format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/json?top=4" should return top 4 close times only (in ascending order) in JSON format

## Website
* Consumer program to service these api requests. This service does not have access to the brevet time calculator
